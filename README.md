# pong
Here are files from the two times that I've failed to make a \[simple\] pong game. One is a gui program using SDL in C, which I lost interest in. The other is a yodascript program which can't print to the terminal fast enough to be playable.

# NOTICE: I quickly got bored with this project and decided to quit. There will be no further development on this project, unless I decide to start again (probably from scratch).

# NOTE: the yodascript version has a framerate too low to be playabe
